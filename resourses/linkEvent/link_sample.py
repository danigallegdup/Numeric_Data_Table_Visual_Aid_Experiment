# DESCRIPTION:
# This script shows how to connect, setup, control and use an EyeLink
# eye tracker to record and most importantly, to retrieve eye EVENTS
# (fixations, saccades, etc.).
#
# In order to eliminate dependency on third party display software like
# Pygame, this example does not present any visual stimuli during trials.
# The script will first show a gray screen, you press ENTER to transfer
# the camera image from the Host PC, and Press C & V to calibrate and
# validate; then, press O to start the experimental trials.
#
# The experiment is made up of three trials. A trial starts with a drift
# check screen (with a fixation dot at the center), followed by a
# 5-second blank screen. During this time, the Host PC screen shows
# fixation update events (cross), fixation end events (number)
# and saccade start and end events (line).
#
# This Pylink code demonstrates the following steps:
# 1-initializing connection to the tracker
# 2-initializing display-side graphics
# 3-initializing data file
# 4-setting up tracking, recording and calibration options
# 5-initial tracker calibration
# 6-Loop over all trials (run_trials)
#
# 6.1-verify connection to tracker and perform a drift-check, i.e.,
#     checking if recalibration is needed (do_trial)
# 6.2-start actual recording of samples and events to the data file
#     and make both available over the link (do_trial)
# 6.3-enter real-time mode and mark trial start time (do_trial)
# 6.4-stub to insert code that loads the initial visual stimulus (do_trial)
# 6.5-mark the time initial visual stimulus came on (do_trial)
# 6.6-wait and make sure we get the start signal for link samples
#     then mark which eye is being tracked (do_trial)
# 6.7-flush outstanding input from response box (do_trial)
# 6.8-open a plain text file to save data; then, poll for newest sample
#     over the link while verifying that tracker
#     is still recording, and termination or setup have not been requested
#     and that the trial time has not exceeded the trial duration (do_trial)
#     save the sample data into a plain text file
# 6.9-end real-time mode, stop recording and clear key presses (end_trial)
# 6.10-record various event counts and mock trial result to EDF file (do_trial)
#
# 7-close and transfer data file from host to display pc
# 8-close EyeLink connection and quit display-side graphics
#
