    label: <b>Messages are IMPORTANT</b> and we need messages in the data file to tell what event happened during a trial <br/>and at what time. Messages should be sent to the tracker everytime a stimulus screen is on or a response has <br/>been issued. You need also to send formatted messages if you plan to use Data Viewer for data analysis and visualization.
