# EyeLink plugin for OpenSesame

The EyeLink plugin was developed to help users to control and to communicate with the EyeLink trackers. The current release does not contain any eye-event triggers, i.e., wait for a fixation of 200 ms in a pre-defined interest area to initiate the presentation of stimulus, but it has most of the frequently used functions and configuration options of the tracker. We encourage users to download the version released on the SR Support website (https://www.sr-support.com/thread-13.html), which implements the tracking practice and options recommended by SR Research, but the user is allowed to modify the source code to meet their experimental needs. Please see the licensing info below.
